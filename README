PC Master Race Project
----------------------
This website was my first AngularJS project. My intentions when I began this were to make a fully operational CMS based website and that I did. 

All the pages are fetched directly from a database where you can easily add and remove pages. (and edit them with ease) 

This project (like my [portfolio](https://github.com/Chizbang/Portfolio)) is powered by the fantastic [dotJEM UI Routing](https://github.com/dotJEM/angular-routing) project!
