PC Master Race Project
=========
This website was my first AngularJS project. My intentions when I began this were to make a fully operational CMS based website and that I did. 

All the pages are fetched directly from a database where you can easily add and remove pages. (and edit them with ease) 

This project (like my [portfolio]) is powered by the fantastic [dotJEM UI Routing]  project!
